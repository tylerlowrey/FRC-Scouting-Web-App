# FRC-Scouting-Web-App
This project holds the source code for the scouting dashboard that is used to display data for my FRC Scouting Android (https://github.com/tylerlowrey/FRC-Scouting-App).

This project is still in development and is not currently in a usable state. I am currently writing the webapp using React for the front-end and I am writing the back-end using Spring Boot (Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST, Spring Security)
